## What is randomized?
* Starting Deck
* Cards from chests, quests, and npcs
* Fairy rewards
* Shop cards
* End of level bonus draw

## What is not randomized (yet)?
* Places you get key cards
* Card combiner
* Capture cards
* Proving Grounds - bonus cards
* Card for defeating Demon Swordsman

## What are key cards?
* Cards needed to beat the game
* Mandragora, Stone Golem, Hell Hound, Birdman, God of Destruction

## What is balanced randomization?
* Replaces cards based on their star level. Also, replaces groups of cards in starting deck and bonus draw.
* If the original game has a 1 star card, you will get a random 1 star card, etc.
* Works with custom card pools
* If your card pool doesn't have any cards with a certain star level, it will try to use the next lower star level first. If no lower levels then it will try a higher star level.

## Current Issues
* Incorrect card texture appears (does not impact gameplay): card throw challenge, trash cards, fairy rewards, defeat bosses, etc.

## Future plans?
* Key card randomization
* Item randomization
* Level randomization
